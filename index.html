                        To honor Nathan, to work to prevent the circumstances
                        that led to his death and to promote the well-being of

                    Nathan Thomas was a 12-year-old boy who tragically died in
                    January 1992. He was taken hostage by an intruder in his
                    home in Portland, Oregon, and was accidentally killed when
                    police tried to rescue him. Nathan's family, the Portland
                    Police Bureau and the Portland community were all
                    traumatized by this tragedy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nathan&rsquo;s parents wrote the following statement,
                    published in The Oregonian, one week after his death.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This tragedy transcends neighborhood boundaries and
                        differences. Every child lost through drugs, poverty or
                        violence is a loss to our whole community. We need to
                        take better care of our children, to recognize children
                        in need and make sure they get the assistance they
                        require. Security is not found in weapons and
                        fortresses, but in holding all members of our community
                        close to our hearts. We need to help each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope in the weeks to come, when the story of
                        Nathan&rsquo;s life and death are gone from the
                        headlines, that we will all remember the sadness our
                        community felt and continue to work to see that this
                        kind of thing doesn&rsquo;t happen again anywhere in
                        Portland.

                    The Nathan McMurry Thomas Fund was founded to honor Nathan,
                    to work to prevent the circumstances that led to his death
                    and to promote the well-being of children and families in
                    the Portland area.
