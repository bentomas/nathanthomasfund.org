                <p>
                    The Nathan Thomas 6v6 Fall Tournament, started by
                    Laurelhurst resident Sue Ofstad the summer after Nathan
                    died, gave young recreational teams in the Portland area an
                    opportunity to compete in a competitive but friendly
                    tournament. Over the years hundreds of children and adults
                    participated in the tournament as players and volunteers. It
                    was more than a soccer tournament, it was a celebration of
                    children, families and neighbors working and playing
                    together with a shared community heart.
