                    Nathan was born in Portland on December 19, 1979. When he
                    was a toddler his family moved to Salt Lake City. Nathan was
                    nearly four years old when he became the proud big brother
                    to Benjamin.

                    Nathan&rsquo;s personality traits included a keen intellect,
                    a strong stubborn streak, a reserved nature and an easy way
                    of making close friends. These traits served him well. He
                    liked challenges at school and in sports, especially soccer,
                    which he started playing at age five. His favorite position
                    was forward and he loved to score goals.

                    When Nathan was 9 years old, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
                    disease, a type of cancer. Nathan went through months of
                    treatment that included radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
                    Throughout the therapy he was determined to go to school and
                    do the things he enjoyed. He made the competitive soccer
                    team and played basketball. At the end of his treatment he
                    was free of cancer.

                <p>
                    Besides playing soccer, Nathan excelled at school. He liked
                    competition in the classroom and on the playground. He also
                    liked to collect sports cards, play with Legos and go hiking
                    and backpacking with his family and friends.

                <p>
                    In July 1991, Nathan and his family moved back to Portland.
                    Nathan started sixth grade at Fernwood Middle School and
                    made the honor roll. He began to make many new friends. He
                    was on a Portland City United classic soccer team and was a
                    finalist in the Fernwood Geography Bee.

                <p>
                    On January 16, 1992, when Nathan was 12 years old, an
                    intruder in his home took him hostage. Police officers tried
                    to rescue him, but gunfire erupted, and Nathan was
                    accidentally shot by the officers. He died a few hours
                    later.

                <p>
                    Nathan&rsquo;s tragic death was a huge loss for his family,
                    his friends, his teammates, the police bureau and all of
                    Portland. We remember Nathan's love of school and sports,
                    his enjoyment of competition, his pleasure in family and
                    friends and his determination to do his best in whatever he
                    set out to do.
