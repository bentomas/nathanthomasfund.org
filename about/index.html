                <h2>History of the Fund</h2>
                <p>
                    Portlanders responded to Nathan&rsquo;s death by comforting
                    each other, remembering Nathan and helping his family, and
                    searching for ways to improve the Portland community. They
                    held meetings and a candlelight vigil at Laurelhurst Park,
                    in Nathan&rsquo;s neighborhood. Those early discussions led
                    to formation of the Nathan McMurry Thomas Fund.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Community Unity Concert, a day of music for Portlanders,
                    was held in Laurelhurst Park in Nathan&rsquo;s memory.
                    Private donations and volunteer work created a new soccer
                    field in Laurelhurst Park Annex. Now called the
                    &ldquo;Nathan Thomas Field&rdquo;, it is actively used for
                    practices and small-sided games. Proceeds from a memorial
                    soccer tournament and individual donations allow the fund to
                    continue to support projects and activities in
                    Nathan&rsquo;s memory.
                </p>

                <h2>Projects Supported by the Fund</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Soccer Outreach</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Nathan loved soccer and, by going to his games, his
                        family became connected to other families and involved
                        in the community. The fund has supported struggling
                        soccer clubs in Portland neighborhoods, purchased soccer
                        goals for schools and community centers and helped new
                        recreational soccer teams.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Literacy Programs</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Nathan was an avid reader and bedtime stories were a
                        family routine. The fund has supported additions to
                        school libraries, early reading classes and literacy
                        programs for families with English as a Second Language.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Improvements in Schools and Parks</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Nathan was a good student and athlete and had many
                        friends. The fund has supported playgrounds, gardens and
                        other improvements in schools and parks that provide
                        environments for enrichment and community activities.

                    <dd>
                        Nathan liked to learn and compete academically and
                        probably would have gone to college. Since he did not
                        get that chance, scholarships in his memory have been
                        given to high school seniors from traditional and
                        alternative public schools to help them achieve their
                        college goals.

                    <dt>Help for At-Risk Children and Families</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The young man who took Nathan hostage had a long history
                        of school problems and juvenile delinquency. The fund
                        has supported special programs for children with mental
                        illnesses, difficult social situations and others who
                        need extra encouragement to succeed in school and to
                        feel a valued part of the community.

                    <dt>Excellence in the Portland Police Bureau</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Portland Police Officers wanted to rescue Nathan, not to
                        harm him. Nathan&rsquo;s death emphasized the importance
                        of an excellent Police Bureau to all Portlanders. The
                        Nathan Thomas Memorial Award is given annually by the
                        Chief&rsquo;s Forum to recognize outstanding performance
                        by a member of the Portland Police Bureau.
