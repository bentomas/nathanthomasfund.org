				<h2>Nathan Thomas Memorial Awards from the Portland Police Bureau</h2>

						for continued devotion and dedication to the people of Portland &ndash; and particularly to the mentally ill. The following was read at the award ceremony:
						<p>You may have seen the picture in the Oregonian newspaper on October 23, 2008: A suicidal man, standing on the railing of the Burnside Bridge, bending slightly as if to hear what the officer is saying. Portland Police Officer Betty Woodward is the officer in the picture, shown extending her right hand to the man. In the end, Officer Woodward talked the man down, and saved him from certain danger.</p>
						<p>When calls of individuals experiencing a mental crisis come into Central Precinct, Officer Woodward is often times called to respond. Officer Woodward's continued devotion and dedication to the people of Portland &ndash; and particularly to the mentally ill &ndash; is an example of her work ethic.  She has, on numerous occasions and sometimes at great personal risk, talked individuals out of harming themselves or others, and has developed a relationship with mental health professionals to help her better understand those going through a crisis.</p>
						<p>Officer Woodward embodies the definition of this award day after day, call after call, and to the betterment of those who need it the most. For your dedication and compassion, Officer Betty Woodward, you are hereby awarded the Nathan Thomas Memorial Award.</p>
